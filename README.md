ðŸš€ Smart Contract Award System â€” Clarity + Clarinet (Web3 Edition)

This repository contains a **unique Clarity smart contract** built with **Clarinet** that powers a **Web3 contract awarding system**.  
The contract is designed to **obtain, win, and finalize** competitive tenders in a transparent, decentralized, and standout way on the Stacks blockchain.  

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project Stands Out

Unlike simple auction templates, this system:
- Implements **secure escrow bidding** in STX.  
- Allows **automatic refunds** for losing bidders.  
- Ensures **transparency** with real-time leaderboards.  
- Provides **finalization logic** to safely transfer winning bids.  
- Is **extendable** to NFT-based awards, DAO tenders, or decentralized grants.  

This is not just an auction â€” itâ€™s a **full-featured Web3 contract awarding platform**.

ðŸ›  Features

- **Initialization**
  - Owner sets contract title, bidding window (start + end block), and minimum bid.  

- **Competitive Bidding**
  - Bids must exceed the current leader.  
  - Escrowed STX ensures serious participation.  

- **Safe Withdrawals**
  - Outbid participants can reclaim their locked STX anytime.  

- **Fair Finalization**
  - After auction ends, the winner is declared.  
  - Winning funds go directly to the contract owner.  

- **Transparency**
  - Everyone can view the current leader and bids in real time.
